# blackout-poetry

Can be done later:

- scroll saved newspaper on mobile
- phone img cutt off
- learn more media queries
- find better inspiration images - once saved, should load new show the same article? -
- no it should not remove it from loadNewArticle, should be added back in load new if they remove the saved article
- make css files modules => css modules create-react-app can be done easily but it would take some time to manually change classes - https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-a-css-modules-stylesheet/
- cross browser css support check
- remove author when poetry is complete
- fix instructions/grammer/spelling
- see if we can set up node for download

Fixed:

- make newspaper smaller
- make saved newspaper style better
- fix stepper to show transparent bg on small screens and have stepper btns wrap around
- add nicer fonts
