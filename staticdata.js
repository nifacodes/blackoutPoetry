            "fullContentText": "Apple now sells refurbished iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max smartphones  through its online store  and at certified retailers. This is good news for anyone who wants to upgrade from an iPhone 8 or older, but might not want to pay full price for an unlocked XS or XS Max (or or make the full jump to an iPhone 11). The XS and XS Max are barely two years old, and their tech is still plenty fast, so they’ll still be solid upgrades.\nThe real question, of course, is how much can you save on a refurbished iPhone XS or XS Max you buy directly from Apple. Exact final pricing depends on the model and configuration you go for, but all iPhone XS models appear to be $200 cheaper than buying new, while you’ll save around $250 for an iPhone XS Max. The highest prices you can expect to pay for the 512GB models of each phone (sans tax) are:\n-  512GB iPhone XS:  $999\n-  512GB iPhone XS Max:  $1,099\n\n(Note: all refurbished models sold by Apple are unlocked).\nFor reference, here’s a quick comparison of those same refurbished 512GB unlocked iPhone XS and XS Max models from popular third-party aftermarket sellers (these prices are based on the current stock at time of writing):\nSwappa\n-  iPhone XS:  $659\n-  iPhone XS Max:  $945\n\nBackmarket\n-  iPhone XS:  $799-$999\n-  iPhone XS Max:  $779\n\nGazelle\n-  iPhone XS:  $650\n-  iPhone XS Max:  $750\n\nRefurb.me\n-  iPhone XS:  $649-$999\n-  iPhone XS Max:  $749-$1099\n\nAs you can see, Apple’s prices are higher than other sellers, but buying from a third-party seller can be a gamble. Unless you’ve bought from a site or seller before, you can’t be sure the device runs as advertised. Some sellers offer warranties or trade-in programs should you wind up with a bad purchase, but it’s not a guarantee.\nConversely, all of Apple’s refurbished devices are  cleaned and tested by Apple  to ensure they meet the company’s quality standards. They’re not going to be as flawless as a brand-new device, but it can be pretty close. You’ll also get a one-year warranty on all devices and can extend coverage through AppleCare+.\nTo be clear, we’re not saying that you should only buy a refurbished iPhone XS or XS Max from Apple, but there are certain benefits Apple’s program guarantees its customers that can make buying one of their refurbished devices less risky, even with the higher prices. If you can find a better deal you trust elsewhere, then go for it. If not, Apple’s store is a decent option if you’re in the market for a slightly cheaper iPhone XS.",

            "fullContentText": "It’s 2020, and you think that it would be easy to stream any content you want on any device you want—especially that brand-new  Picard  series on CBS All Access. If you’re an ubergeek who loves both  Star Trek  and Linux, you’re out of luck. Thanks to the joys of digital rights management, or DRM, you’re unable to use CBS’ All Access service to stream Picard on Linux.\nIn a cruel twist, not only can you not stream the show, but you  can  stream all the bullshit that comes wrapped around it. As Ars Technica’s Jim Salter  describes  :\n“Moving back to one of my own PCs, I was quickly able to confirm the issue: trailers autoplay properly, and even the ads work—but the actual content won’t play on a Linux desktop PC on any browser including Google Chrome. Diving into the Chrome Web Console, we can see HTTP 400 (Bad Request) errors when the browser attempts to fetch a license from CBS’  Widevine  back end.”\nThe more tech-savvy among you are probably assuming that you can just change your browser’s user agent to fool CBS All Access into thinking you’re using a supported platform. Not so. (Salter tried that, too.) For whatever reason, Widevine and CBS All Access don’t play nice with Linux, even though other streaming services that use Widevine have no issues.\nThe only workaround to this vexing problem, aside from watching CBS All Access on a different device entirely, is to cancel your regular CBS All Access subscription and instead subscribe to the service via  Amazon Prime Video  . Yes, you’ll need to be an existing Amazon Prime member for this to work (in the U.S., at least), which will already set you back $120 annually. After that, adding CBS All Access costs the same as if you were subscribing standalone: $6/mo for limited commercials or $10/mo for commercial-free streaming.\nThat is, however, slightly more than you’d pay if you signed up for an annual plan  via CBS itself  ($60/year for limited commercials and and $100/year for no commercials). Amazon doesn’t offer these options, so this route is best if you’re only planning to binge a show or two and then cancel your service. If you’re looking to stick with CBS All Access for the long haul, you might just want to try not watching it on Linux; a tablet, phone, or app on your Smart TV will save you more cash.",

            "fullContentText": "Targeted ads, the kind that might appear on your Facebook feed or Twitter timeline, can feel awfully invasive; after all, they often appear using personal information like your location, age or search history. And thanks to a new service making waves on social media, they’re likely about to target you even more closely.\nRecently, if you’ve ever stumbled across a tweet or Instagram in which a celebrity posts their “phone number” so that they can interact with and text you directly, it’s not what you think—instead of entering into a personal chat with a celebrity, you’ve  actually  subscribed to a newsletter of automated updates that’ll be sent by text.\nBack in October, reporter Taylor Lorenz described how it works in detail for the  New York Times  . If you “text” a celebrity using this number, you’re likely signing up for a service run by a tech-startup called  Community  ; they help manage direct messaging with large audiences on behalf of celebrities and other well-known figures, as a way of “monetizing” their social network.\nOnce you opt-in by way of text, what kind of updates might you receive? Well, it depends. Sometimes, it’s just a random string of photos and texts, as Lorenz received from actor Ashton Kutcher. I signed up for  Pod Save America’s  Jon Favreau’s updates and just received a bunch of updates about their tour.\nIf you’re really, really lucky, you  could  a text back from the celebrity in question—but don’t count on it. Given the number of messages they likely receive, it would seem like a huge effort just to respond to every text. The vast majority of the time, you’re likely only at the receiving end of these automated updates.\nIf you’re a particular fan of a celebrity, maybe signing up isn’t such a bad idea. But we’ll do you a favor and tell you now that it probably isn’t worth it. The odds are incredibly low that you’ll receive a text that isn’t just an automated update, and while  Community ensures  that they will not sell your personal details to other third parties, well,  we’ve all heard that before  , haven’t we?",

            "fullContentText": "Tech 911  Do you have a tech question keeping you up at night? We'd love to answer it! Email david.murphy@lifehacker.com with \"Tech 911\" in the subject line.  Prev  Next Your laptop computer is a delicate beast. It can take a pounding, perhaps even a dropping, up to a certain point. It might survive a fall from the desk without a scratch, but bumping it with something heavy in just the right way, at just the right time, could end it all.\nYour desktop PC is a bit more protected, in theory, since it probably lives in a bulky case. That doesn’t mean it’s invulnerable. Though we weren’t sent this question by a Lifehacker reader, as is custom for the  Tech 911  column, I stumbled across this call for help on Reddit and couldn’t resist highlighting it in this this week’s edition. It’s just that good.\nRedditor  u/dyingquickly  describes  :\n“I lightly bumped my computer it shot off and makes no attempt to boot when I hit the power button. I know my PSU is working because I have a tester. I’ve triple checked all my connections. Does anyone know what the problem might be? The light of the on button doesn’t even appear, it’s as if the button isn’t working but i don’t know what the problem is.”\nGenerally speaking, when your computer zaps off like that, it’s a pretty good indication that you’re going to have to do some troubleshooting. If you’re lucky, you’re only dealing with a random power outage or loose cable—possibly even a button on your surge protector that you brushed up against. You should be able to correct the problem and turn your system back on again, suffer a quick disk scan, and resume whatever it is you were doing. (Here’s hoping your work or  browser tabs  autosaved.)\nWhen your system  doesn’t  turn on is when this process really gets fun.\n\nCHECK FOR LOOSE CABLES\nSuppose you bang into your desktop PC with your chair, your foot, or your stupid but loveable pet runs into it. We’ll classify this as a “hard” bump, not a gentle dusting. If your desktop PC won’t turn back on—as in, it won’t even POST—my first assumption is a crucial cable has fallen out of a connector  just enough  to cause an issue.\nThis is going to be annoying, but I recommend popping open your desktop PC and making sure everything looks right. If some cable isn’t connected in some awkward way, that might be the culprit—though your motherboard’s primary power cables  should  have locking mechanisms that make this impossible.  I wouldn’t rule anything out  . In fact, I’d start with them: the fat 24-pin cable and the smaller 4/8-pin cable.\n\nSTART DISCONNECTING AND RECONNECTING CRITICAL CABLES\nIf a loose cable isn’t immediately apparent, you might want to take the more annoying step of unplugging everything that’s plugged in and reconnecting it. I’d start with more critical cables first—those going into your motherboard, graphics card, and modular power supply (if applicable). You can try your SATA cables, too, as well as the power connections for your hard drive(s). (Though your motherboard should still be able to POST without a hard drive connected, let’s not take any chances.)\nYou’ll also want to check your system’s tiny front-panel connectors. While a loose front-panel cable would explain why you can’t turn your system back on, you’ll also likely be able to surmise this is the issue if your motherboard is otherwise powered on (via any lights you see). If your motherboard has its own power button you can use to start your system, and pressing that makes everything work correctly, then you’re likely dealing with some issue with your front-panel cables.\nAlso, make sure you’re checking the rear of your system. There are plenty of cables back there—the power cable, especially—so it’s possible that something got jiggered out of place in such a way as to prevent your computer from turning on. Again, this might feel like try-anything troubleshooting, but I’m willing to bet that the answer to this issue is going to be some random cable you wouldn’t have normally thought about in your troubleshooting. Heck, you can even try resetting the CMOS battery; I doubt it’s the culprit, but it’s worth exploring if your other ideas don’t pan out.\nIt’s also possible that you bumped something out of place in your case that is now causing some kind of short-circuit with your motherboard. That could be a cable; that could be a screw that you accidentally left in your system when you were building it. However, short of eyeballing the problem, taking your system apart and rebuilding it is likely going to be the best way to address this. Given how long that might take to do, I’d save it as a final option.\nAnd if you go this route, be  methodical  . Strip your system to the bare components. Take the CPU and cooler off your motherboard, remove the RAM, and unplug everything (to name a few steps). Once you’re staring at a bunch of components, plug everything back in as if you’re  building a computer for the first time  . Connect the basics—your motherboard, your RAM, and your video card (if applicable)—and try powering on your system. Can you make it into the BIOS? If so, power down your PC and start adding your other hardware one at a time, until you can deduce what, if anything, is causing issues.\n\nTRY FIGURING OUT WHICH COMPONENT HAS FAILED\nAnd if you still can’t power on your PC, you might want to phone a friend. Slap your hard drive into their system or external enclosure to confirm your data is safe (and back it up, if need be)? See if you can borrow an extra power supply to use with your core components. Do they have any extra RAM you could try? Will your video card work on their system?\nAt this point, you’re likely trying to pinpoint faulty hardware, since odds are getting higher that you actually did some kind of damage to something inside your system. Hopefully you don’t have to reach this point; I’ve been there, and it’s not a fun bit of detective work.\nDo you have a tech question keeping you up at night?

            "fullContentText": "It should come as little surprise that any content you offer to the web for public consumption has the potential to be scraped and misused by anyone clever enough to do it. And while that doesn’t make this weekend’s report from  The New York Times  any less damning, it’s a great reminder about how important it is to  really  go through the settings for your various social networks and limit how your content is, or can be, accessed by anyone.\nI won’t get too deep into the  Times’  report; it’s worth reading on its own, since it involves a company (Clearview AI) scraping more than three billion images from millions of websites, including Facebook, and creating a facial-recognition app that does a pretty solid job of identifying people using images from this massive database.\nEven though Clearview’s scraping techniques technically violate the terms of service on a number of websites, that hasn’t stopped the company from acquiring images  en masse.  And it keeps whatever it finds, which means that turning all your online data private isn’t going to help if Clearview has already scanned and grabbed your photos.\nStill, something is better than nothing. On  Facebook  , likely the largest stash of your images, you’re going to want to visit  Settings >  Privacy  and look for the option described:  “Do you want search engines outside of Facebook to link to your profile?”\nTurn that off, and Clearview won’t be able to grab your images. That’s not the setting I would have expected to use, I confess, which makes me want to go through all of my social networks and rethink how the information I share with them flows out to the greater web.\n\nLOCK DOWN YOUR FACEBOOK EVEN MORE WITH THESE SETTINGS\nSince we’re already here, it’s worth spending a few minutes wading through Facebook’s settings and making sure as much of your content is set to friends-only as possible. That includes changing  “Who can see your future posts”  to “friends,” using the  “Limit Past Posts”  option to change everything you’ve previously posted to friends-only, and making sure that only you can see your friends list—to prevent any potential scraping and linking that some third-party might attempt. Similarly, make sure only your friends (or friends of friends) can look you up via your email address or phone number. (You never know!)\nYou should then visit the  “  Timeline and Tagging  ”  settings page and make a few more changes. That includes only allowing friends to see what other people post on your timeline, as well as posts you’re tagged in. And because I’m a bit sensitive about all the crap people tag me in on Facebook, I’d turn on the “Review” options, too. That won’t help your account from being scraped, but it’s a great way to exert more control over your timeline.\nFinally, even though it also doesn’t prevent companies from scraping your account, pull up the  “  Public posts  ”  section of Facebook’s settings page and limit who is allowed to follow you (if you desire). You should also restrict who can comment or like your public information, like posts or other details about your life you share openly on the service.\n\nONCE I FIX FACEBOOK, THEN WHAT?\nHere’s the annoying part. Were I you, I’d take an afternoon or evening and write out all the different places I typically share snippets of my life online. For most, maybe that’s probably a handful of social services: Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, Flickr, et cetera.\nOnce you’ve created your list, I’d dig deep into the settings of each service and see what options you have, if any, for limiting the availability of your content. This might run contrary to how you use the service—if you’re trying to gain lots of Instagram followers, for example, locking your profile to “private” and requiring potential followers to request access might slow your attempts to become the next big Insta-star. However, it should also prevent anyone with a crafty scraping utility to mass-download your photos (and associate them with you, either through some fancy facial-recognition tech, or by linking them to your account).\nWill you be able to fully prevent someone from finding a way to build the next big database of searchable images? Probably not. But the most important lesson we can take from situations like these—Clearview AI’s...well...existence—is that you should understand the nuances of the services you share your information to, and you should always use your settings to restrict access to your data in whatever way you feel most comfortable. Were I you, I’d err on the side of “let trusted people see what I do instead of anyone on the internet,” but that’s just me.",

            "fullContentText": "Tech 911  Do you have a tech question keeping you up at night? We'd love to answer it! Email david.murphy@lifehacker.com with \"Tech 911\" in the subject line.  Next I normally use  this weekly column  to answer people’s technology-themed questions. This week, I’m taking a slight departure, because I think sharing a reader’s story is important—even though there’s not really much I, nor Google, can do in the case of her locked Google account. There’s a lot we can learn from her example, and a few items you should check to make sure this frustrating issue never happens to you.\nLifehacker reader  Cathryn  writes:\nI stupidly forgot my Google account password back in November 2019, I had only just changed it. I asked them to email to text me a verification code, like I’d done so many times before, however I stupidly added the 2 step verification on my account.\nThe problem was I inputted an incorrect recovery email address, I missed 2 digits off my email. Therefore the 2 step verification wouldn’t work. Google locked my account, I also broke my mobile phone screen days later that I ended up buying a new handset but the same mobile phone number.\n[...]\nI only get asked 1 security question “what was your first phone number” I picked that question myself in the security settings a long time ago. Then I get asked to give them an email they can contact me on, then a few days later I receive an email stating they don’t have enough evidence so unfortunately they can’t open my account.\nI never get asked any questions such as when was your account created. I’ve tried recovery options from my laptop, kindle ect that used the same gmail account plus it’s all from my home IP address.\nI get it’s my fault for initially forgetting my password, but google security settings are flawed as when I put a recovery email they should send an automatic email confirmation to make sure it’s correct due to human error. I’ve lost lots of important document and 9 years of Google photos with some pictures of loved ones that I’ll never get back.\nI present this reader story as a cautionary tale. First, whenever you’re dealing with two-factor authentication or any kind of account-recovery options—whether you’re inputting your email or phone number to set it up, or you’re copying down precious backup codes—it’s critical that you triple-check this information. That’s not because there’s no way to change it; you can obviously change details like your email address or phone number if you have access to your account. However, you’re less likely to this because most people assume that everything is on the up and up once they’ve set up their accounts. And if it isn’t, and you left a typo in a critical account recovery option, you’re going to have a mess of a time when you try to restore access.\nGoogle makes this entire situation particularly frustrating because they, a giant search company that practically prints money, have no desire to set up a customer service center that Google users can call whenever they have issues with Google’s services. Regular (free) Google users get a  Help Center  and some community forums, but that’s it.\nAnd while I’m a little snarky about this, I do see Google’s point of view. First off, most people aren’t paying Google a dime for the services they’re using. Yes, Google is doing everything it can to extract data from you so it can better target you with relevant advertising, but most people aren’t coughing up cash for the privilege of using Gmail, for example. You might pay Google a little per month  for some extra storage  , but that’s about it. Why dedicate a not-so-insignificant amount of resources to a service center for free services?\nSecond, and more importantly, Google’s lack of one-to-one help for issues like account recovery is actually a security measure in itself. Consider the alternative: If someone sort-of knew your email address, phone number, and/or mailing address, in combination with some information they’ve pilfered from one of the many data breaches out there, would you want them to be able to convince a Google customer service representative that they are actually you?\nGiving everyone the same, generic account recovery process, and letting nobody have access to any special favors or extra support, makes it harder to get into a locked account when you have unique issues, sure. It also makes it harder for others to get into  your  account. I’m not saying I’m a fan of this trade-off—because real people  do  have complex issues that need special help—but it does help limit an unscrupulous person’s ability to social engineering their way into your Google account.\nThis puts the burden on you to make sure that all of your recovery mechanisms for your Google account are accurate. Even if you’ve already set them up and are feeling pretty good about it, I recommend taking a quick few minutes to double-check. It never hurts, because you don’t want to deal with the alternative of not being able to access your account in the event of some major mess or security breach.\nTo get started, visit the  Security  section of your Google account settings. Scroll down a bit to the “Ways we can verify it’s you” list of questions and make sure your phone number, recovery email address, and security question are all accurate.\nNext, scroll up a smidge and click on  “  2-Step Verification  .”  You’ll have to enter your password again. On the subsequent screen, make sure that you’ve turned  on  Google’s two-step verification to better protect your account. Assuming you have, scroll down a bit and click on “Show Codes” under the “Backup codes” section.\nCopy. These. Codes. Down.  To paraphrase Gandalf, keep them secret and safe; you’ll use them to log back into your account if, for whatever reason, you can’t access the device(s) you’ve set up for two-step verification.\nFinally, go visit the  Personal info  section of your Google account settings and double-check that your actual contact information is correct: email(s) and phone number(s). While you’re here, you might as well also make sure you’ve entered your correct birthday, too.\nAnd, of course, the best way to make sure you never forget your passwords to anything is to use  a strong password manager  . Even if it costs you a few bucks a month, it’s worth every penny. Not only does this make it easy to keep track of your passwords, but you can use stronger, more secure passwords that are  very  difficult to guess or brute-force. Also, a great password manager will let you know whenever your saved accounts are compromised in a data breach (which should be less of an issue if you’re using unique passwords for each service, but people can get a little lazy about this).\nThat’s my advice to everyone, and it applies to more than just Google. If a service is important to you, make sure you know the process of how you’ll get back into your account if you’re ever locked out. Then, check your data to make sure any errant typos won’t come back to haunt you, and make sure you’ve saved any backup codes or any other information you need in order to regain access to a lost or locked account. You’ll be glad you did now, if (or when) you have to deal with this later.\nDo you have a tech question keeping you up at night? Tired of troubleshooting your Windows or Mac?

            "fullContentText": "Games are capped at 1080p and 60 fps.  NVIDIA's GeForce Now cloud gaming service is live\nAfter seven years of tweaking its delivery systems and gathering beta feedback, NVIDIA has  finally unveiled the consumer version of its game-streaming ecosystem  . GeForce Now streams games of all sizes to PC, Mac, Android and the NVIDIA Shield, and it works with players' existing libraries on Steam, the Epic Games Store and all other digital platforms.\nA free option allows folks to connect to NVIDIA's servers and play for one hour at a time. After an hour, these players will need to reconnect and potentially wait for a spot to open up on the servers. In the paid tier, players go to the front of the line when logging on, they'll stay online for up to six hours and get access to RTX hardware.\nAnd release dates for some highly anticipated shows.  Disney+ has 28.6 million subscribers so far\nIn Disney's first earnings report since the launch of Disney+, the company announced  how many people have signed up for its streaming service  . As of Monday, the number is 28.6 million, which CEO Bob Iger said he doesn't expect to change significantly until this fall. That's when October's  The Mandalorian  season two arrives, as well as MCU-spinoff shows  Falcon and the Winter Soldier  (August) and  Wandavision  (December).\nIt's OK, though, they apologized.  Google Photos bug sent private videos to strangers\nIf you used Google Takeout to back up your Photos files from November 21st to 25th, 2019, a stranger out there may have a copy of your videos. During that period, the email reads, \"some videos in Google Photos were incorrectly exported to unrelated users' archives.\" That means  someone out there may have a copy of your (hopefully wholesome) videos  , and you may have a copy of someone else's, as well.\nDon't forget the augmented reality navigation system.  2021 Cadillac Escalade packs 38 inches of curved OLED screens and Super Cruise\nCadillac is introducing a new Escalade later this year, and inside you'll find three curved OLED screens in the dashboard. There's a 7.2-inch touch panel to the driver's left, a 14.2-inch screen info cluster behind the steering wheel and the 16.9-inch infotainment system. With \"perfect\" black levels and bright colors, the screens don't need hoods over them to block out the light.\nThe luxury SUV line also packs five USB ports (three of them are USB-C), wireless charging, an optional 36-speaker audio system that uses mics to let front and rear passengers communicate, Super Cruise driving assist that can now change lanes by itself, NFC and electric motors that help the doors close quietly.  Check out all the details and get a closer look here  .\nThe show is scheduled to start February 24th.  LG pulls out of Mobile World Congress over coronavirus concerns\nAs concerns over a growing coronavirus outbreak continue to mount, LG has decided that the Barcelona-based trade show  simply isn't worth the risk  . Instead, LG will hold separate events in the \"near future\" to reveal its batch of 2020 smartphones, which is expected to include a sequel to last year's ambitious, underwhelming G8 ThinQ.\n\nBUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE...\n-  Iowa Democrats say sloppy app code delayed caucus results\n-  Sony sets prices for (most of) its 2020 4K LED TVs\n-  'Altered Carbon' season two teaser shows Anthony Mackie as the 'new' hero\n-  Now T-Mobile and Sprint can verify calls across their networks to prevent robocalls\n-  KFC slips ads into Spotify Premium through artist profiles\n-  Dyson patents a wearable air purifier that doubles as headphones\n-  SpaceX asks permission to take Starship on a high-altitude test flight\n-  Rockstar Games co-founder Dan Houser is leaving the company\n\nThe Morning After is a new daily newsletter from Engadget designed to help you fight off FOMO.

            "fullContentText": "The company is initially offering two services: YubiEnterprise Subscription (which is available now), and YubiEnterprise Delivery (which is slated for release in spring). YubiEnterprise Subscription is an annual per-user pricing model that allows companies to subscribe to a specific service tier based on how many users they need to support. The idea is that by moving away from a per-key purchasing model, organizations can better predict future spending and upgrades. This one is designed for businesses with 750 YubiKey users or more.\nThe second offering, YubiEnterprise Delivery, takes care of the actual logistics of key distribution. Via a dedicated Yubico portal (or software that can be integrated directly into existing IT software using public APIs) IT administrators can keep a track of who needs access to which keys, and the service will manage inventory, ship keys to the relevant people, monitor delivery and manage returns or replacements.\nYubico is one of the biggest players in the security key business -- and its tech is widespread across  Windows  and  iOS  devices -- so it's not a surprise that it's the first one to make this kind of offering. And it's much-needed -- businesses overall are gradually waking up to the benefits of security keys, but until now the logistical challenges in implementing them means they've largely been the sole preserve of smaller companies. Yubico's enterprise service opens the tech up to much larger companies, which will no doubt help accelerate its adoption overall.\nIn this article:  2FA  ,  business  ,  design  ,  enterprise  ,  gear  ,  hardware authentication  ,  personal computing  ,  personalcomputing  ,  security  ,  security key  ,  service  ,  Yubico  ,  Yubikey\n\nAll products recommended by Engadget are selected by our editorial team, independent of our parent company.

        "fullContentText": "Apple now sells refurbished iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max smartphones  through its online store  and at certified retailers. This is good news for anyone who wants to upgrade from an iPhone 8 or older, but might not want to pay full price for an unlocked XS or XS Max (or or make the full jump to an iPhone 11). The XS and XS Max are barely two years old, and their tech is still plenty fast, so they’ll still be solid upgrades.\nThe real question, of course, is how much can you save on a refurbished iPhone XS or XS Max you buy directly from Apple. Exact final pricing depends on the model and configuration you go for, but all iPhone XS models appear to be $200 cheaper than buying new, while you’ll save around $250 for an iPhone XS Max. The highest prices you can expect to pay for the 512GB models of each phone (sans tax) are:\n-  512GB iPhone XS:  $999\n-  512GB iPhone XS Max:  $1,099\n\n(Note: all refurbished models sold by Apple are unlocked).\nFor reference, here’s a quick comparison of those same refurbished 512GB unlocked iPhone XS and XS Max models from popular third-party aftermarket sellers (these prices are based on the current stock at time of writing):\nSwappa\n-  iPhone XS:  $659\n-  iPhone XS Max:  $945\n\nBackmarket\n-  iPhone XS:  $799-$999\n-  iPhone XS Max:  $779\n\nGazelle\n-  iPhone XS:  $650\n-  iPhone XS Max:  $750\n\nRefurb.me\n-  iPhone XS:  $649-$999\n-  iPhone XS Max:  $749-$1099\n\nAs you can see, Apple’s prices are higher than other sellers, but buying from a third-party seller can be a gamble. Unless you’ve bought from a site or seller before, you can’t be sure the device runs as advertised. Some sellers offer warranties or trade-in programs should you wind up with a bad purchase, but it’s not a guarantee.\nConversely, all of Apple’s refurbished devices are  cleaned and tested by Apple  to ensure they meet the company’s quality standards. They’re not going to be as flawless as a brand-new device, but it can be pretty close. You’ll also get a one-year warranty on all devices and can extend coverage through AppleCare+.\nTo be clear, we’re not saying that you should only buy a refurbished iPhone XS or XS Max from Apple, but there are certain benefits Apple’s program guarantees its customers that can make buying one of their refurbished devices less risky, even with the higher prices. If you can find a better deal you trust elsewhere, then go for it. If not, Apple’s store is a decent option if you’re in the market for a slightly cheaper iPhone XS.",
